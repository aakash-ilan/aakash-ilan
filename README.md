## Hi, I'm Aakash

I'm a high school student who loves computer programming and basketball.
I enjoy building small projects, learning how things work, and solving problems using code.
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on the basketball court practicing my shots or playing a game with friends.

I'm excited to share my projects here as I learn and grow!
